# About the Project

This project is designed to make working with the European Space Agency's DISCOS API a lot easier. It will provide a basic C# SDK from which other applications and integrations can build off.

This project is not affiliated with the ESA and I started it to make querying the DB for data needed for my PhD easier.

## Project Status

The project is currently at a very early stage and is not yet functional. I'm always going to appreciate input from anyone who wishes to get involved.
